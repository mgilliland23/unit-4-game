# unit-4-game

This is a simple jQuery based RPG game using characters from Star Wars. Each character is assigned health points, attack, and counter attack points. A player selects his character and then another character to face off against. The player attacks and their character's attack points increase by their base attack after each move, and their health points decrease by the defending character's counter attack. If the player eliminates all characters before their health points fall below 0, they win the game.
